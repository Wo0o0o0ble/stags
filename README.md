Stephen's useful Template And Data Grabbing Scripts

This collection of shorts scripts and functions were intended for use
with various computational chemisty codes and programs, primarily for grabbing
useful numbers from large data files. A number of similar scripts were created
over the course of my PhD and will slowly be added to this collection as I
neaten things up and work on similar projects again.

Anyone that might find them useful is welcome to use them.
